# To-do-List
A to-do list is a simple and effective organizational tool used to manage tasks and responsibilities. It typically consists of a list of items, each representing a task or activity that needs to be completed. Users create to-do lists to keep track of what they need to do, prioritize their tasks, and ensure that nothing important is forgotten.  
This project is a labor of love, entirely developed and meticulously maintained by me, and I'm excited to announce that more updates and enhancements are in the pipeline! Stay tuned for even more improvements and features to make this project even better.  

Thankyou <3.
